Steps to build a simple yet effective and powerful application in Streamlit.

1. Install Streamlit using pip install streamlit or conda install streamlit.

2. Import the required libraries like streamlit, sklearn, matplotlib and pandas

3. Make a simple structure for your page with all the basic details and aim of the project.

4. Importing the data into our application.[In this case the diamonds.csv and new_diamonds.csv] and analysing the data

5. Collect user's inputs for the parameters of the model.
   (giving some inputs to the model so that it can predict)

6. Train Our Model

7. [BONUS] - Replicating the Linear Regresison model built in the udacity course 

8. Finally adding code on Github and host on Streamlit!
